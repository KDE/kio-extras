If you are patching this code, please be very sensitive to performance issues.
The parser is already very slow and resource intensive.  Be careful not to add
any extra string iterations (copies, QCString.length(), etc), mallocs, or
implicit object creation/copies.  Use calltree before and after your patch to
verify that it is not too expensive, along with cpu usage timing and even
wall clock time.
