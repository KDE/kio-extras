# Requirements for this script:
#
# 1. When the external search program (e.g. `rga`, `rg`) is not installed, 
#    exit with status 127. `kio-filenamesearch` (called by the Dolphin search)
#    will then use the its (slower) fallback search code.
#
# 2. STDOUT should only contain paths separated by '\0'. Paths can be either
#    absolute or relative to the current directory.
#
# 3. If search is successful, either the exit code should be 0, or STDERR should
#    not contain any output. Because `rg` returns 1 when no matches are found,
#    and returns 2 when there are broken symlinks or permission errors, we can't
#    rely solely on the exit code being 0 to determine success. So we also considers
#    a non-zero exit code AND an empty STDERR to be a success.
#
# 4. So, when the search fails (other than the "not installed" case in point 1),
#    in addition for exiting with a non-zero status, you should also print an error
#    message to STDERR. The message will be displayed to the user in Dolphin.
